Describe who you envision as the user(s) of your program and how their use
of the system might differ:

Potential users: movie/show critics, casual movie/show watchers

Movie critics would use the service to find movies and rank/review them.

Casual movie watchers would use the service to find information on movies/shows to
determine what to watch (i.e. look at reviews to see if they would want to watch the movie).

Both types could use the service to look up technical information on the movie such as
runtime, length, etc.
