Our database is centered around movies. Movies are directed by directors, produced by production studios, nominated for awards, win awards, acted in by actors, described by a genre. 
The database will be a web based GUI that users can interact with to get info about specific actors movies and comparisons between tables of the database. 
Since the GUI is not the main focus all the front end design will be done with plain html css and javascript. 
The movie table has the most attributes associated with it but the many relationships to it comprise the other informaiton. 
Movie wins Award is a one to one relationship.
Production Studio produces movie is a one to many relationship.
The rest are many to many relationships.
