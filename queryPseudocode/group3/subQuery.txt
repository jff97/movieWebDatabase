find the names of the actors who have appeared in the most number of movies along with the count of movies they have acted in.

this satisfies group 3 by using a query inside a query inside a query

SELECT Actor.FirstName, Actor.LastName, COUNT(*) AS MovieCount
FROM Actor JOIN ActsIn 
ON Actor.ActorId = ActsIn.ActorId
GROUP BY Actor.ActorId
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
   SELECT MAX(MovieCount) FROM (
      SELECT COUNT(*) AS MovieCount 
      FROM ActsIn
      GROUP BY ActorID
   )
)
